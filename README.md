	This program is intended for use with CSV data files in order to extract and plot Stress and Strain data of defined CSV files. 

To obtain this program: 
	Clone or download from my git respository at https://github.com/bbaer92/p1-start

Use of this program requires access to the following: 
	Matplotlib.plot
	Python3
	numpy

Data must be properly formatted prior to executing the program. 
	Conditions:
		X values: Strain - Data entry must begin on Row 33 and be contained in column 8 of CSV file. 
		Y values: Stress - Data entry must begin on Row 33 and be contained in column 4 of CSV file. 


What does this program do?
	This program is intended to plot the relationship of a materials stress and strain.
	 It will calculate the line of best fit for the data set and plot the raw data against he line of best fit for comparison. 


What I've learned from this project: 
	Saving even small changes and seeing the number of commits rise is really satisfying! 
	Though I'm sure by the 150th commit on a still unfinished project I might start losing my mind.
	
	Also, because I'm used to the arrow keys on a keyboard navigating VIM wiht HJKL still feels like 
	driving a car with handlebars. Still awkward!
	
	During this project I realized I was able to interpret the syntax errors better towards the end. My eyes became accustomed
	to finding that specific line with the actual error and kind of tuning out the rest of the fluff that comes with it. 
	
	Overall this was a quick and easy project for the most part. I really enjoyed compiling several of the skills we've learned 
	through the course to this point.
